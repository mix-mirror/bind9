# The bind.keys file is used to override the built-in DNSSEC trust anchors
# which are included as part of BIND 9.  The only trust anchors it contains
# are for the DNS root zone (".").  Trust anchors for any other zones MUST
# be configured elsewhere; if they are configured here, they will not be
# recognized or used by named.
#
# To use the built-in root key, set "dnssec-validation auto;" in the
# named.conf options, or else leave "dnssec-validation" unset.  If
# "dnssec-validation" is set to "yes", then the keys in this file are
# ignored; keys will need to be explicitly configured in named.conf for
# validation to work.  "auto" is the default setting, unless named is
# built with "configure --disable-auto-validation", in which case the
# default is "yes".
#
# This file is NOT expected to be user-configured.
#
# Servers being set up for the first time can use the contents of this file
# as initializing keys; thereafter, the keys in the managed key database
# will be trusted and maintained automatically.
#
# These keys are current as of November 2024.  If any key fails to
# initialize correctly, it may have expired. This should not occur if
# BIND is kept up to date.
#
# See https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml for current trust
# anchor information for the root zone.
